# Project 2: Linear regression and error handling
* Implemented linear reggression for revenue prognostic through machine learning and math.
* Controlled accuracy of the linear regression through MSE, MAE, coefficient of determination and RMSE.
* Compared linear regression trough machine learning with linear regression through math.

## Code and resources used
* Python 3.9.15.
* Packages: pandas, numpy, math, seaborn, matplotlib.pyplot, statistics, sklearn.model_selection, sklearn.linear_model.
* dataset: 500 rows of daily revenue by temperature of a ice cream shop in IceCreamData.csv

## Data cleaning
* Just a overview was requiered, because of non null-values:
